Please read the JinniUserGuide.html file in directory "bin",
where you can start running Prolog right away by typing 

jinni 

on Windows and equivalent commands on Linux/Unix.

Here is the directory structure (* marks components
only available with Source Edition).

+---bin <=========== START HERE TO WORK WITH JINNI
|   +---agentlib => agents
¦   +---classlib => Object Oriented Prolog classes
¦   +---progs    => classic Prolog programs
¦   +---vprogs   => visual programs
+---build * scripts to generate various components
+---doc * 
|   +---jdoc     ==> Java class documentation
¦   +---papers   ==> Related papers and projects
¦   +---tutorial ==> Introduction to Prolog
+---prolog * JAVA SOURCES
¦   +---kernel *
|   +---core *
+---psrc * PROLOG SOURCES
+---tests *

The distribution contains a few related projects, untested
recently but most likely easy to get running.

Scripts (mostly .bat files) in directories other than
MainProlog have not been tested recently but might
be useful, especially on Windows platforms.

CallProlog - an interface to call Jinni from Java
GP - a simple Genetic Programming framework
PROLOG3D - a Java3D interface to Jinni
