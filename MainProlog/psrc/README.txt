This directory contains Prolog sources (available to owners
of a source license).

To bootstrap the compiler in Java, do:

type

jc.bat

then

?-jboot.

It will regenerate the file wam.bp.

You can do the same, with BinProlog, by going
to directory ../build and typing:

bp build

and then

?-jboot.
